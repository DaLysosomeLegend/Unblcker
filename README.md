# Unblcker

This is an unblocker i made. Honestly, im a beginner, so it might not work. It shuld, bc it is a good proccess, but ur school might block the links. In order for it to work, you must deploy it on render.


In order to do so, go to render, make an account if you have to, and connect github(or just sign into render using github).

After that, you must click deploy a website, it will usually do the first one for u, u just have to connect github, and choose this repository. Then you can make the enviroment node, build command npm install, start command npm start, use ur prefferred region, and use the main branch. Change the name to something educational, as a reccomendation. 

After that, you must create a neocities site. The code is:

<form method="GET" action="https://theeducationalgov.onrender.com/search/">
  <input name="url" placeholder="https://example.com">
  <button type="submit">Go</button>
</form>

For those of you who do not know, this is an html file u need to make on neocities.org. 

Then, take ur website and input it into the proxy on neocities. This shuld work, I havent tried it yet.

I am currently still working on this repo, so give me time and come back for updates!
